                <p> Firebase is a toolset to “build, improve, and grow your app”, and the tools it gives you cover a large portion of the services that developers would normally have to build themselves, but don’t really want to build, because they’d rather be focusing on the app experience itself. This includes things like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging, and the list goes on. The services are hosted in the cloud, and scale with little to no effort on the part of the developer.</p>

                    <p>The Google Chrome Web browser is based on the open source Chromium project. Google released Chrome in 2008 and issues several updates a year. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS operating systems. The Google Chrome browser takes a sandboxing-based approach to Web security. Each open website runs as its own process, which helps prevent malicious code on one page from affecting others (or the computer operating system at large). The browser also supports Web standards such as HTML5 and cascading style sheets (CSS).</p>

                    <p>The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. Its used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

                        In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application s entire user interface.</p>
